CrashReader

This is a small utility for extracting key pieces of information from unsymbolized
crash dumps (in minidump format). It is intended to run in your browser, thanks to
the power of WebAssembly.

Originally this is developed for several projects in Mass Effect Legendary modding
scene, but there is no reason why it shouldn't be usable with unrelated dumps.
