CrashReader

This is a small utility for extracting key pieces of information from unsymbolized
crash dumps (in minidump format). It is intended to run in your browser, thanks to
the power of WebAssembly.

Originally this was developed for a few projects in Mass Effect: Legendary Edition
modding scene, but there is no reason why it shouldn't work with unrelated dumps.
